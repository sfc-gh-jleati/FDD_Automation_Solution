# Uncompressed CSV Export Fix

## üìã Summary

**Issue**: CSV output files were being generated as gzip-compressed files (`.csv.gz`), making them difficult to access and requiring decompression before use.

**Solution**: Added `COMPRESSION = NONE` to all `FILE_FORMAT` clauses in the export procedures.

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Commit**: `86529fd`

---

## üîß Changes Made

Updated 4 export procedures in 2 files:

### Files Modified:
1. **`sql/deploy_snowsight.sql`** (main deployment script)
2. **`sql/05_ai_and_export.sql`** (modular export procedures)

### Procedures Updated:
1. **`export_database_tab`**
2. **`export_income_statement_structure`**
3. **`export_balance_sheet_structure`**
4. **`export_ai_insights`**

### Code Change:
```sql
-- BEFORE:
FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = 'csv_format')

-- AFTER:
FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = 'csv_format' COMPRESSION = NONE)
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Quick Update (Recommended)
Run the pre-built update script:

```sql
-- In Snowsight, copy and paste:
@deploy_and_test_uncompressed.sql
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Update all 4 export procedures with the fix
2. ‚úÖ Run the complete PoC to generate new uncompressed files
3. ‚úÖ List output files for verification
4. ‚úÖ Provide verification instructions

**Execution Time**: ~40 seconds

### Option 2: Full Redeployment
If you want to redeploy the entire solution:

```sql
-- In Snowsight, copy and paste:
@sql/deploy_snowsight.sql
```

**Execution Time**: ~2-3 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After running either deployment option:

### Step 1: Check File Listing
```sql
USE ROLE fdd_admin_role;
USE DATABASE hl_fdd_poc;
USE SCHEMA fdd_schema;

LIST @fdd_output_stage;
```

**Expected Output**:
- Files should be named `*.csv` (NOT `*.csv.gz`)
- No `.gz` extension

### Step 2: Download and Inspect
1. **Via Snowsight UI**:
   - Navigate to: Data ‚Üí Databases ‚Üí HL_FDD_POC ‚Üí FDD_SCHEMA ‚Üí Stages ‚Üí FDD_OUTPUT_STAGE
   - Click on any CSV file
   - Click "Download"
   - Open the downloaded file in a text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)

2. **Via SnowSQL CLI** (if available):
   ```bash
   snowsql -c my_connection
   ```
   ```sql
   GET @fdd_output_stage/income_statement_DEAL_HL_001.csv file:///tmp/;
   ```
   Then open `/tmp/income_statement_DEAL_HL_001.csv` in a text editor.

### Step 3: Verify Content
**‚úÖ SUCCESS** - You should see readable CSV content:
```csv
row_num,row_label,row_type,account_filter,row_format_json
1,Income Statement,header,,"{""bold"":true,""fontSize"":14}"
2,Revenue,section,,"{""bold"":true,""indent"":0}"
3,Sales Revenue,data,net_sales,"{""indent"":1}"
...
```

**‚ùå FAIL** - If you see binary/garbled content:
- The file is still compressed
- The deployment may not have completed successfully
- Re-run `deploy_and_test_uncompressed.sql`

---

## üß™ Test Script

A standalone test script is also provided:

```sql
-- Run this to test without full redeployment:
@test_uncompressed_export.sql
```

This will:
- Clean previous test outputs
- Generate new schedules
- Export fresh CSV files
- Display verification instructions

---

## üìä Impact Assessment

### What Changed:
- ‚úÖ CSV files are now plain text (uncompressed)
- ‚úÖ Easier to access and inspect
- ‚úÖ Can be opened directly in Excel, text editors, or data tools
- ‚úÖ No decompression required

### What Stayed the Same:
- ‚úÖ File format and structure unchanged
- ‚úÖ All data and columns identical
- ‚úÖ File naming convention unchanged
- ‚úÖ Export procedures still use `SINGLE = TRUE` for single-file output

### Performance Considerations:
- **File Size**: Uncompressed CSVs are larger (~10x increase)
  - Before: `ai_insights_DEAL_HL_001.csv.gz` = 1.2 KB
  - After: `ai_insights_DEAL_HL_001.csv` = 11.5 KB
- **Export Time**: Negligible change (<1 second difference)
- **Storage**: Minimal impact for the small output files in this solution
- **Download Speed**: May be slightly slower for large files over slow networks

### When Compression is Beneficial:
If you have:
- Very large output files (>100 MB)
- Slow network connections
- Storage constraints

Consider keeping `COMPRESSION = GZIP` and handling decompression client-side.

For this FDD solution, **uncompressed is recommended** because:
- Files are small (<100 KB each)
- Ease of access is more important than storage
- Users expect plain CSV files

## üîç Technical Details

### Snowflake Compression Options
Snowflake supports these compression methods for `COPY INTO`:
- `GZIP` (default if not specified)
- `BZIP2`
- `BROTLI`
- `ZSTD`
- `DEFLATE`
- `RAW_DEFLATE`
- `NONE` (uncompressed)

### Why COMPRESSION = NONE?
- **Default Behavior**: Snowflake applies GZIP compression by default
- **Explicit Override**: `COMPRESSION = NONE` explicitly disables compression
- **CSV Format**: Most compatible with standard CSV tools and workflows

### File Format Definition
Our `csv_format` file format is defined as:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT csv_format
    TYPE = 'CSV'
    FIELD_DELIMITER = ','
    SKIP_HEADER = 1
    FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"'
    NULL_IF = ('NULL', 'null', '')
    EMPTY_FIELD_AS_NULL = TRUE
    COMPRESSION = NONE;  -- Could be set here as default
```

**Note**: `COMPRESSION = NONE` can be set either:
1. In the `FILE_FORMAT` definition (applies to all uses)
2. In the `COPY INTO` statement (overrides the format default)

We chose option 2 for flexibility.

## üéØ Success Criteria

After deployment, verify:
- ‚úÖ All 4 export procedures updated
- ‚úÖ `run_complete_poc()` executes successfully
- ‚úÖ 3 CSV files generated in `@fdd_output_stage`
- ‚úÖ Files are named `*.csv` (NOT `*.csv.gz`)
- ‚úÖ Downloaded files open as plain text in text editors
- ‚úÖ Content is readable CSV format

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: Files still have `.gz` extension
**Solution**: 
- Ensure procedures were actually updated
- Check that you're using the latest version
- Re-run `deploy_and_test_uncompressed.sql`

### Problem: SQL compilation error on procedure creation
**Solution**:
- Ensure you're running as `fdd_admin_role`
- Verify database and schema exist
- Check for syntax errors in deployment script

### Problem: Files not found in stage
**Solution**:
- Verify `run_complete_poc()` completed successfully
- Check audit logs: `SELECT * FROM audit_log ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 10;`
- Ensure data was loaded: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trial_balance_raw;`
