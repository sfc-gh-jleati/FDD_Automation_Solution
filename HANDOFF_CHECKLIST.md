## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Snowflake account with Enterprise edition or higher
- [ ] ACCOUNTADMIN role access (for initial deployment)
- [ ] Warehouse available (SMALL or larger recommended)
- [ ] Snowflake Cortex enabled (for AI insights)
- [ ] SnowSQL CLI installed (optional, for CLI deployment)

### Preparation

- [ ] Review `README.md` for solution overview
- [ ] Review `HANDOFF.md` for technical architecture
- [ ] Read `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` completely
- [ ] Identify deployment approach (Snowsight UI vs. SnowSQL CLI)
- [ ] Prepare sample CSV files for testing

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Snowflake (15 minutes)

**Recommended: Snowsight UI**
1. Open [Snowsight](https://app.snowflake.com/)
2. Create new worksheet
3. Copy entire contents of `sql/deploy_snowsight.sql`
4. Execute all (‚åò+Enter or Ctrl+Enter)
5. Wait ~2-3 minutes for completion

**Alternative: SnowSQL CLI**
```bash
snowsql -c your_connection
!source sql/deploy.sql
```

### Step 2: Upload Sample Data (2 minutes)

```sql
USE DATABASE HL_FDD_POC;
USE SCHEMA TRIAL_BALANCE;

PUT file:///path/to/01_sample_trial_balance_24mo.csv @fdd_input_stage;
PUT file:///path/to/02_sample_account_mappings_24mo.csv @fdd_input_stage;
```

### Step 3: Run Production Validation (5 minutes)

```sql
!source tests/production_validation.sql
```

Verify all checks show ‚úÖ PASS

### Step 4: Test Complete Workflow (1 minute)

```sql
CALL run_complete_poc();
LIST @fdd_output_stage;
```

Expected: 3-4 CSV files in output stage

### Step 5: Verify Excel Integration (5 minutes)

1. Download `database_tab_DEAL_HL_001.csv`
2. Open your Excel FDD template
3. Import into Database tab
4. Verify SUMIF formulas populate with data

---

## üß™ Validation Criteria

### Deployment Success

- [ ] All 14 tables created
- [ ] All 5 views created
- [ ] All 16 procedures created
- [ ] Both stages created (input, output)
- [ ] Zero SQL compilation errors
- [ ] System config initialized (23 parameters)

### Data Loading Success

- [ ] Trial balance: 696 rows loaded
- [ ] Account mappings: 29 rows loaded
- [ ] `is_active = TRUE` for all 29 mappings (CRITICAL!)
- [ ] Views return expected row counts
- [ ] No errors in `load_errors` table

### Output Generation Success

- [ ] `database_tab_*.csv` created (20+ KB) **CRITICAL**
- [ ] `income_statement_*.csv` created (3+ KB)
- [ ] `balance_sheet_*.csv` created (1+ KB)
- [ ] Files are uncompressed (plain CSV, not .gz)
- [ ] Files contain actual data (not empty)

### Excel Integration Success

- [ ] database_tab CSV has 30 lines (1 header + 29 accounts)
- [ ] database_tab CSV has 60 columns
- [ ] Imports into Excel without errors
- [ ] SUMIF formulas show numeric values (not #REF! or #N/A)

## üêõ Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: ai_insights CSV Not Generated

**Symptom:** Only 3 CSV files created instead of 4  
**Cause:** Sample data has low variance, doesn't meet threshold  
**Resolution:** This is normal! AI insights only generate when:
- Variance > 20% (configurable in `system_config`)
- Amount > $5,000 (configurable)

**To Test AI Insights:** Load data with higher variances or adjust thresholds:
```sql
UPDATE system_config 
SET config_value = TO_VARIANT(0.10)  -- Lower to 10%
WHERE config_key = 'variance_threshold_pct';
```

### Issue 2: database_tab CSV is Empty

**Symptom:** File created but 0 bytes or empty  
**Cause:** `account_mappings` table has `is_active = NULL`  
**Resolution:** **Already fixed in code!** The `load_account_mappings` procedure now sets `is_active = TRUE` automatically.

**Verify Fix:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM account_mappings WHERE is_active = TRUE;
-- Should return 29
```

### Issue 3: Views Return 0 Rows

**Symptom:** `v_database_tab_pivoted` returns 0 rows  
**Cause:** Account mappings not loaded or `is_active = NULL`  
**Resolution:** Reload account mappings:
```sql
CALL load_account_mappings();
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM account_mappings WHERE is_active = TRUE;
```
